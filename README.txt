This was a semestral project for a Digital Image Processing class at CTU, in summer semester 2014/2015.

As-rigid-as-possible real-time image deformation was implemented in Python 3.4 64 with computationally extensive parts written in C. Python libraries used were: numpy, Pillow and TkInter.

For compilation of the library there's a very very minimal makefile added. Application wasn't tested on anything else but Windows 7 64bit.

For starting application use main.py, in which there's a hardcoded path to image.

For adding and moving control point use left mouse button, for removing use right mouse button.
